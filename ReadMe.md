Closing Remarks:
Unfortunately, do to time constraints, I was unable to provide a comprehensive document detailing testing, debugging, and optimization of all the programs, run the tester class to see the basic (but configurable) tests preformed!
Overall, I really enjoyed the programming aspect of this course, and I hope we continue the trend going forward.

ALSO: I'm really interested in any feedback you'd like to give me, and I'll take it to heart and try to become a better developer.
